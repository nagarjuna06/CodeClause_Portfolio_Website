        Welcome to my web development portfolio! As a fresher, I have embarked
        on an exciting journey to learn and explore the vast world of web
        development. Through various projects and hands-on experiences, I have
        gained proficiency in different technologies and frameworks. This
        portfolio serves as a showcase of my skills, creativity, and growth as a
        web developer.
      </p>
      <h3>Technical Skills:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b> HTML: </b>
          I have a strong foundation in HTML, which is the backbone of any web
          page. I can create well-structured and semantically correct HTML
          markup, ensuring accessibility and compatibility across different
          devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> CSS: </b>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allow me to bring life and aesthetics to
          web pages. I have learned to use CSS to create visually appealing
          designs, apply animations, and ensure responsiveness for a seamless
          user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> JavaScript: </b>
          I have acquired a solid understanding of JavaScript. I can develop
          interactive and dynamic web applications, enhance user interactions,
          and implement client-side validation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Bootstrap: </b>
          Utilizing the Bootstrap framework, I have honed my skills in building
          responsive and mobile-first websites. This framework has enabled me to
          create visually consistent designs while maintaining flexibility
          across different screen sizes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Front-End Frameworks: </b>
          I have familiarized myself with popular front-end frameworks like
          React.js. These frameworks have empowered me to build complex and
          interactive user interfaces, manage state efficiently, and develop
          single-page applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Back-End Development: </b>
          Through learning languages like Javascript and frameworks like
          Express.js, I have gained an understanding of back-end development. I
          can create server-side logic, manage databases, and develop RESTful
          APIs to facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end
          components.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Version Control: </b>
          I have experience using Git, which enables me to effectively
          collaborate with other developers, track changes, and manage different
          versions of my projects.

        <h3>Quiz Application:</h3>
        <p>
          In this app, the quiz questions can be of multiple-choice, true/false,
          or short-answer format. The user selects their answer(s) and submits
          their responses. The app then scores the user's answers and displays
          the result to the user. The React.js library is commonly used to build
          the user interface (UI) of the quiz application. React.js allows
          developers to create reusable UI components that can be easily updated
          based on user interactions. The React.js UI components can be designed
          to match the visual theme of the quiz application and provide an
          intuitive user experience.

        <h3>QR -Code-Generator:</h3>
        <p>
          The QR code generator app is designed to create QR codes for any text
          input provided by the user. The app is capable of generating QR codes
          that can be scanned by any QR code scanner to reveal the information
          embedded in the QR code. The text to QR code generator feature makes
          it easy for users to convert any text into a QR code.
